EnvInject API Plugin
===

This is an API plugin, which encapsulates [Jenkins EnvInject Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/envinject-lib) 
and provides additional API for environment variable management within Jenkins plugins.

This API plugin is mainly used in the [EnvInject Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/envinject-plugin/), 
but it can be used in other plugins as well.
As an API plugin, it guarantees backward compatibility of API and does not contribute any user-visible components by default.
